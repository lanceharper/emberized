#### Flashcards
* cards have two sides: 1) prompt; 2) answer
* cards are organized into stacks
	* stacks have a title
	* stacks reference cards
	* single card may be contained by zero or more stacks 
* stacks index: listing of available sets of flashcards
* study mode: drill-down of cards in given stack: prompt side displayed beside/above answer side
* test mode: shuffled prompts displayed one-at-a-time. Click/touch to flip for answer. Swipe/click arrow for next/previous.
